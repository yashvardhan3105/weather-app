# weather-app
This is a repo for a Website I am building using JavaScript and it's Libraries like ReactJS for API and error handling, HTML for code structure, CSS for styling the page.

Introduction:
How I started:
1. Create a folder on your desktop, name it whatever you like.
2. Open the folder in VSCode and open a terminal.
3. In the terminal type 'npx create-react-app weather-app-um' and after it's created, in the same terminal type 'npm install react-router-dom' (optional).
4. After all this step, I made a Components folder in the weather-app-um folder, to store the files in an organized manner.
5. I made a Weathers folder and in it, I added Weathers.jsx and Weathers.css.

Problem Solving:
1. The problem given to me was on the topic Weather App and in it, I had to make one input field which will contain the City/Location value and the other element was a button which will search for the City/Location.
2. I had to also display the Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed. Hence I made the following divs and named them accordingly. I gave the className so that I can use the .innerHTML attribute to update the values.
3. Now the problem was the CSS aspect or the designing, I haven't started on it yet.
4. Then the problem was on the JavaScript to handle and fetch APIs which I did by using the API found on https://api.openweathermap.org and I then used the keyword let, which is used when the data is not supposed 
to be accessible outside the block of code it's present in. Then I made a asynchronous function named Search which would accept the API, break it down into Location, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed.
5. Upon testing, I found that the images don't change with the given temperatue. I am yet to learn that.

Conclusion: I completed the Weather App by 6th December, 2024.
